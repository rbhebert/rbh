  <summary>“Alcohol, Pregnancy, and Health Outcomes” </summary>
  
  Abstract: Alcohol negatively impacts health outcomes at every stage of pregnancy, from conception timing to childhood development. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder alone is estimated to cost \$1.29-10 billion annually in the U.S. Despite this, relatively few public policies can affect alcohol consumption by women of reproductive age. This study aims to examine state-level alcohol excise taxes and signs warning of the dangers of drinking during pregnancy posted at the point-of-sale. I survey more than thirty years of data across six sources describing the full scope of potential health outcomes. Employing contemporary difference-in-differences methods and a novel approach to alcohol excise taxes, I find that neither policy leads to significant changes in drinking behavior or fetal health outcomes, contrary to earlier research.
